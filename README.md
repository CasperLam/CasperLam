<h1 align="center"> 👋 Hi, I’m Casper </h1>

✈️ I've studied aero engineering at uni.
😎 I've done technical dispensing of glasses.
📦 I've been a product manager.
💻 Now I'm a full-stack developer!

The common theme throughout my career has been a love for problem solving, and I'm looking for the next challenge.

Having completed my software engineering training with BrainStation my biggest takeaway has been how good it feels to look back on my work and think "look at that, I built that!"
